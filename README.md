# NLP-PICO-LSTMModel

This is an early work of the activity we are doing. This is sentences labelling task with LSTM model. There are 7 tags / labels which are used to label the sentences of the medical text. The labels are Aims, Design, Setting, Participants, Intervention, measurement, 
findings and conclusion.
The configuration file has the parameters for the LSTM such as learing rate, epoch , batch size etc. 
The evolved transformer models are used to implement the same Sentence labelling task.
